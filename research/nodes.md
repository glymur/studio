### resilient channel

Never use 'hat channel' only RC-1 (walls) or RC-2 (ceiling)

### caulk

- Possible caulk brand: Sika

- Regarding caulk on sole plate of walls:
> Only caulk, to seal the gap air-tight. As you put down the sole plate, also put down three beads of good-quality caulk: one right down the middle of the sole plate, and the other two about 2cm each side of that. Then put it in place, and put the bolts through it, into the slab, then tighten them. Then run another bead of caulk along the two edges. And one more bead under the bottom of each layer of drywall.
